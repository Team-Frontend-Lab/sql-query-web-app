# Frontend Lab - SQL Query Web App

![Design preview for the SQL Query Web App frontend assessment](./preview.png)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this frontend assessment.

[Frontend Lab](https://www.frontendlab.io) assessments help you sharpen your coding skills through real-world projects, making it easier to succeed in frontend assessments or machine coding rounds.

**To do this challenge, you need a good understanding of React, JavaScript and CSS.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build a SQL Query Web App using React or any other frontend framework of your choice.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the assessment. So, if you have something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

If you come across any design elements in the design file that are not specified in the requirements, you are only expected to create the UI. Developing functionality for these elements is optional.

**Requirements:**

- **This is a dummy application**
- You must include a space to accept SQL queries. This can be as simple as a textarea or
as complex as a full-blown code-editor
- Your application does not need to have a backend, a query engine or query validation
- You do not need to add any syntax validation
- The data that your application displays can be any chunk of data. It does not need to be
the actual result that the query would display if it was actually run. You can choose any
block of data from [here](https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-examples/tree/master/examples/northwind/data/csv) or you can choose any other data source. The data and the
query do not need to be in sync.
- You can write down any query you wish. The query is not important, nor is the result. You
are free to put in dummy stubs and mocks wherever the need arises.
- Your application must have more than one query accompanied by its corresponding
table of data. You can have a predefined set of queries and a predefined set of tables
showing some data.
- You must also provide a way for us to toggle between these queries and choose any
query and view the table of data accompanying it. It can be a dropdown or any other
toggling mechanism.
- Think of all the features you feel would be mandatory for this application. Features that
make the application just usable. Something that, if removed, would render the whole
application pointless.
- Assume that a data analyst is going to use your application for an entire day. What are
the features that will help them breeze through the dayâ€™s workload?
- Use a JavaScript framework for your application, such as [React](https://react.dev), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), or any
other framework.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build the project based on the designs in the `/design` folder, where you'll find the desktop version. However, it's not mandatory to follow these designsâ€”you can also incorporate your own design if you prefer.

The designs are provided in PNG static format, but unlike our competitors who charge for the **Figma design file**, we offer it completely **FREE** on our platform under the assessment page. Use our Figma design file at no extra cost and save time on guessing styles like `font-size`, `padding`, and `margin` etc.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read-through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, and we provide some recommendations below.
3. Review the designs and requirements to begin planning how you'll tackle the project.
   
## Deploying your project

As mentioned above, there are many ways to host your project for free. Our recommend hosts are:

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting)

## Create a custom `README.md`

We strongly recommend creating your own `README.md`. A custom `README` will help you explain your project and reflect on your learnings. 

It should also include installation and setup instructions.

## Submitting your solution

Submit your solution on the platform to receive admin feedback. After submission, you'll receive admin feedback on your assessment within 24 hours.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Functionality: The application should meet all the requirements and work correctly without errors.
- UI/UX: The application should have a clean and intuitive user interface.
- Code Quality: The code should be well-organized, modular, and follow best practices.
- Documentation: The README.md file should be clear and comprehensive, providing all the necessary information to understand, install, and run the project.

## Sharing your solution

There are multiple places you can share your solution:

1. Share your live URL and GitHub repository in the **#finished-projects** channel of our [community](https://discord.gg/ATStc5QVdv). 
2. Tweet [@teamfrontendlab](https://twitter.com/teamfrontendlab) and mention **@teamfrontendlab**, including the repo and live URLs in the tweet. We'd love to take a look at what you've built and help share it around.
3. Share your solution on other social channels like LinkedIn.
4. Blogging about your experience building your project is a fantastic way to reinforce what you've learned. Share your workflow, explain your technical choices, and walk through your codeâ€”these insights not only help solidify your knowledge but also provide valuable learning for others in the community. Great platforms to write on are [Medium](https://medium.com/), [dev.to](https://dev.to/), and [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/).

## Got feedback for us?

We love receiving feedback! We're always looking to improve our assessments and our platform. So if you have anything you'd like to mention, please email teamfrontendlab@gmail.com.

This challenge is completely free. Please share it with anyone who will find it useful for practice.

**We're looking forward to seeing what you can create!** ðŸš€
